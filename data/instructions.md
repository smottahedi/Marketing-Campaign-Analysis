# Intro
In this archive, you will find three datasets describing a marketing campaign 
run by WidgetCo. This campaign was sent as part of a campaign to reengage customers 
who had bought a widget the previous year. The datasets are as follows:
- email_data.csv: a file containing email send, open, and click events for this campaign over one month
- orders.csv: a file containing events for purchases of WidgetCo's products.
- params.csv: a file containing parameters describing WidgetCo's customers.

On the basis of your analysis of these three files, report to WidgetCo whether 
the campaign was effective, and where or how it was most effective. Identify a 
specific set of customers who should receive a follow-up campaign or campaigns, 
and describe the content of those campaigns.

# Format
As possible, please return your analysis as a document or notebook readable by
statistically literate peers, with summaries as necessary to make it
comprehensible to business/marketing stakeholders.

Any code you use to generate the analysis should be returned as well, in a 
runnable format.
