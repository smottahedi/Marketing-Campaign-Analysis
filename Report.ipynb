    "The objective of this study is the analyze WidgetCo marketing campaign to re-engage customers who bought a widget the previous year. First, the effectiveness of the marketing campaign is determined by comparing few metrics such as conversion rate and generated revenue between customers who received marketing email (Treatment group) and those who didn't (Control group). Next, the subset of customers who should receive follow-up campaign and the content of the campaign are identified Uplift Modeling."

In addition, sending marketing campaign to customers that previously ordered trinket with advertising related to trinkets is more effective."

    "The performance of the marketing campaign was measured by calculating the conversion rate and uplift metrics. The conversion rate of customer who received the marketing email was $9.6\\%$ higher compared to the customer who didn't. The uplift which is a measure of the incremental increase in conversion rate when customers exposed to marketing campaign emails is $0.81$. Both metrics show that the marketing campaign was effective. Uplift modeling resulted in the identification of $25\\%$ of customers where future marketing campaign will increase the conversion rate. The logistic regression used in uplift modeling showed that targeting customers with high lifetime revenue and content related to trinket product will increase the probability of conversion."
